# LAB Embedded Team

* The goal is to provide the software foundations for the LAB electronic projects.
* This means providing working tools and embedded firmware to other members. This should be either part of a given project or under specific request(s).
* It could lead also to LAB embedded training session for members, from beginner to advanced levels.
* The team is open to everyone motivated!

# LAB Embedded Team
The LAB owning a bunch of Atmel SAM4S Xplained boards (ARM Cortex-M4 based), they will be used as a basis for initial work.

Updates will appear in a (ir)regular basis on the LAB Wiki
